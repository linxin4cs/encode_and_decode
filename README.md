English | [中文](./README.zh-CN.md) 

**A repository for learning about encoding**

It contains notes on common encoding algorithms [notes](./note.md) and encoding and decoding [scripts](./src/).

The scripts are written in Python language and only use some basic APIs. The core algorithms are all handwritten.

Current progress:
  - [BASE64](./src/base64.py)
    - [x] Encoding
    - [x] Decoding
  - ......
